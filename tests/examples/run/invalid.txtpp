This run directive is invalid because the prefix is empty:

TXTPP#run echo hello

The preprocessor uses the prefix to determine when to terminate a multi-line directive.
Therefore it will never be able to terminate it.

(It can technically terminate it if the directive is indented,
but for simplicity, we just disallow empty prefixes.)
