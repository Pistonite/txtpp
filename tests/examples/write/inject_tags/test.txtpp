The content of the write directive will not have tags injected,
because it is technically output of a directive.

0TXTPP#tag TAG_IN_WRITE
1TXTPP#run echo foo
3TXTPP#write some content with TAG_IN_WRITE in it.

However, since write is a directive, you can store its output in a tag

0TXTPP#tag TAG_WRITE
1TXTPP#write some content with TAG_IN_WRITE in it.

Note that the tag is still not injected, but now both TAG_IN_WRITE and TAG_WRITE have stored content.
